<p><b>Scrolling down for Chinese texts</b></p>
<p>With most browsers the procedure for viewing a Chinese text will take you directly to the beginning of the required discourse (shown in red type). However, with some browsers it may instead take you to the beginning of the relevant juan (卷 fascicle). In this case you may need to scroll down some distance to reach the required discourse.</p>
<p>To reach it more quickly you can use the "Find" function, typing in the relevant page number, register (a, b, or c), and line number (1 to 29), copied from the "Correspondences" table. For example, if you began from DN 26 and then clicked DA 6 in the list of its parallels, you may instead be taken to the beginning of DA 5 (at p0036b28; i.e., page 36, register b, line 28). The beginning of DA 6 is further down - at 39a21, according to the "Correspondences" table.</p>
<p>Exceptionally, for any of the 47 discourses contained in T 150A (= EA2) you always need to scroll down, regardless of which browser you are using. Also, for some discourses contained in Chinese Vinaya texts, you may need to scroll down to find the beginning of the relevant section.</p>
